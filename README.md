#React Music Player

This is a React music player I created after learning React. You can view a live demo [here](http://tatenda.info/react-music-player/index.html) where I used random instrumentals with album artwork which I have designed for clients in the past. See also [behance page](https://www.behance.net/gallery/48137829/Music-Player-App)

## Getting up and running

Make sure you have node installed on your machine. At time of writing the code I had node v7.4.0 installed, however as I recently updated webpack-dev-server to the latest 2.2.0 version, consider using node v6 as [recommended by the core team](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server#readme)

First install npm packages boot up start webpack-dev-server

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Go to "http://localhost:8080" in your browser to view app

## Improvements

This was a basic implementation which can be improved (feel free to submit PR!). I'm considering doing a video tutorial series where I'll build current app from scratch. I'll then extend it to include functionality to add new songs and update songs.json file, implement Redux for state management and so on. Will see how much free time I have and whether this repo gains any interest.
I'll upload the Sketch file of the app onto my dribble account soon
